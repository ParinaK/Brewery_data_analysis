Worked on brewery dataset to unlock insights and see patterns

### Dataset:
Dataset is available on Kaggle (1GB). I am sharing the link to dataset below
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankurnapa/brewery-operations-and-market-analysis-dataset

The data available is in the following points
- Brewing Parameters: Includes crucial brewing factors such as fermentation time, temperature, pH level, gravity, and ingredient ratios. These parameters are pivotal in understanding the brewing process and its impact on the final product.
- Beer Styles and Packaging: The dataset categorizes beers into various styles like IPA, Stout, Lager, etc., and records the type of packaging used (kegs, bottles, cans, pints).
- Quality Scores: Each batch is rated for its quality on a scale, offering insights into the success and consistency of different brewing approaches.
- Sales Data: Detailed records of sales figures, providing a window into the market performance of different beer types across various locations in Bangalore.
- Supply Chain and Efficiency Metrics: Tracks aspects like volume produced, total sales, brewhouse efficiency, and losses at different stages (brewing, fermentation, bottling/kegging), crucial for supply chain analysis and operational optimization.

  ### Objective

- Brewing Process Optimization: Ideal for analysis aiming to correlate brewing techniques with beer quality, facilitating the optimization of brewing conditions for superior product quality.
- Market Analysis: Sales data across different styles and locations offer valuable insights for market trend analysis and strategic planning.
- Supply Chain Management: The dataset is instrumental in identifying bottlenecks in the supply chain and enhancing inventory management strategies.
- Quality Assessment and Control: By analyzing quality scores against brewing parameters, the dataset supports initiatives in quality control and consistency maintenance.
